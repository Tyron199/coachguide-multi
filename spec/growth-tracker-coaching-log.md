# Growth Tracker - Coaching Log Implementation Plan

## Overview
Based on the screenshot analysis, the Coaching Log is a comprehensive dashboard that shows a coach's client roster with aggregated coaching session data. This page will serve as a central hub for coaches to track their coaching activities across all clients.

## Screenshot Analysis
From the provided screenshot, the coaching log table displays:

### Table Columns (Left to Right):
1. **Client** - Client name and avatar
2. **Company** - Client's associated company  
3. **Coaching Sessions** - Total number of sessions conducted
4. **Hours** - Total coaching hours accumulated
5. **Start Date** - Date when coaching relationship/first session began
6. **End Date** - Date when coaching relationship/last session ended (or ongoing)

### Key Features Observed:
- Clean, modern table design with proper spacing
- Client avatars for visual identification
- Sortable columns (indicated by column headers)
- Search/filter functionality (search bar visible)
- Date range filtering capability needed for historical analysis
- Pagination controls at bottom
- Professional styling consistent with the app's design system
- No status or actions columns visible in the screenshot

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. CoachingLogController Enhancement
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/Tenant/Coach/CoachingLogController.php`

**Required Methods:**
- `index()` - Main coaching log view with aggregated data
- `export()` - Export functionality for coaching log data
- `clientDetail()` - Detailed view for specific client coaching history

**Data Aggregation Needed:**
- Total sessions per client within date range
- Total hours per client within date range
- Start date (first session date or coaching relationship start)
- End date (last session date or coaching relationship end, null if ongoing)
- Company information
- Session attendance rates
- Date range filtering capabilities

#### 2. Database Queries & Performance
**Optimizations Required:**
- Eager loading of relationships (client, company, sessions)
- Aggregated queries to avoid N+1 problems
- Proper indexing for performance
- Caching for frequently accessed data

#### 3. Data Structure
```php
// Expected data structure for frontend
[
    'clients' => [
        [
            'id' => 1,
            'name' => 'John Doe',
            'email' => 'john@example.com',

                'end_date' => '2025-09-20',   // Last session or null if ongoing
                'attendance_rate' => 95.8
            ]
        ]
    ],
    'summary' => [

#### 1. Controller Logic
```php
public function index(Request $request) {
    $coach = auth()->user();
    
    // Get date range filter (default to last 6 months if not specified)
    $startDate = $request->get('start_date', now()->subMonths(6)->startOfDay());
    $endDate = $request->get('end_date', now()->endOfDay());
    
    // Get coach's clients with aggregated session data within date range
    $clients = $coach->assignedClients()
        ->with(['company'])
        ->withCount(['clientSessions as total_sessions' => function($query) use ($coach, $startDate, $endDate) {
            $query->where('coach_id', $coach->id)
                  ->where('client_attended', true)
                  ->whereBetween('scheduled_at', [$startDate, $endDate]);
        }])
        ->withSum(['clientSessions as total_hours' => function($query) use ($coach, $startDate, $endDate) {
            $query->where('coach_id', $coach->id)
                  ->where('client_attended', true)
                  ->whereBetween('scheduled_at', [$startDate, $endDate]);
        }], 'duration')
        ->addSelect([
            'start_date' => CoachingSession::select('scheduled_at')
                ->where('coach_id', $coach->id)
                ->whereColumn('client_id', 'users.id')
                ->where('client_attended', true)
                ->orderBy('scheduled_at', 'asc')
                ->limit(1),
            'end_date' => CoachingSession::select('scheduled_at')
                ->where('coach_id', $coach->id)
                ->whereColumn('client_id', 'users.id')
                ->where('client_attended', true)
                ->orderBy('scheduled_at', 'desc')
                ->limit(1)
        ])
        ->get();
        
    // Apply additional filters (search, company)
    // Calculate summary statistics
    // Return paginated results with date range info
}
```
